# Colors:
## Text Colors:
The class that we use for text color is simply called `text` and then we add the name of the color with adding hypen and the name of the color, like this: `text-black`. But to be noticed black and white does not have a shade but other colors come in shades starting from 50 - 900. There are various colors provided by css, please refer to tailwindcss docs.
## Background Colors:
As same as the text we also have classes for background color, the class that we use is called `bg` and then name of the color and the shade seprated by the hypen, for example `bg-red-500`. The best thing about tailwindcss that we can refer to or combine multiple classes. For example black background and black text does not make sense so we can do something like this: 
```
<p class="bg-black text-white>Some Text</p>
```
Just remember to seperate the classes with whitespace.
